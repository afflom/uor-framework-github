# Universal Object Reference Framework

The UOR Framework is an API that facilitates the interaction of all elements in an information system.

### UOR Facilitates:
 - Normalizes distribution as a standardized dataset format for all data types in an information system.
 - Publishes data attributes as a schema in the dataset object.
 - Exposes all dataset content and metadata via content addressable API.
 - Distributes data objects and runtime together as attributable layers in a dataset.
 - Makes all data knowable and attestable pre and post retrival.
 - Makes all data attributes discoverable before retrival. 
 - Establishes the basis for attribute based mutating dataset queries.
 - Flattens all data objects, real objects, and conceptual objects as attributable data objects.

### All datasets are stored with up to 3 spec DAGs
 - Graph 1: OCI Artifact manifest (required)
 - Graph 2: Object Attributes manifest (required)
 - Graph 3: Relational Attributes (optional)

### What can it do?
 - Identity Attribute and Attestation (Identity Provider)
 - Object Attribute and Attestation (Inventory Management)
 - Conceptual Object Attrubution (Digitized Idea Records)
 - Dynamic Information System Provisioning (Infrastructure & Node Provisioning)
 - Dynamic Relational Dataset Assembly
 - Secure Supply Chains (Attestable, Verifyable, Reproducible Software & Data Supply Chains)
